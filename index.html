         <p>
            WELCOME TO ALL CURIOUS VISITORS!!!! SO YOU TOO ARE SEEKING THE ENLIGHTENMENT ONLY POSSIBLE THROUGH COMMUNICATION WITH THE UNKNOWN, THOSE BEYOND OUR REALM????
            I, too, began like you. I am Kurata Tome, a third year at Salt Middle School, and despite my young age I have CONTACTED THOSE BEYOND OUR SIMPLE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. I dedicated my LIFE to seeking out THE WISDOM OF THOSE UNBEKNOWNST TO HUMANKIND, the EXTRATERRESTRIAL, by means of the only power theorectically strong enough to reach their attention across THE VAST REACHES OF SPACE. That is to say, HUMAN TELEPATHY. For many years, I toiled in vain, but this year I SUCCEEDED. I am now, at the recommendation of my employer, SHARING THE INDESPENSIBLE THOUGHTS OF ONE TOUCHED BY REAL STARMEN... WITH YOU! Read on, and learn about the LIMITS OF COMPREHENSION...

            <h4>A MISSING LINK FOR THE MISSING LINK: THE LINK BETWEEN BIGFOOT AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS???</h4>
            Ask any American walking through the sweeping forests of the United States of America who they wish they could meet, and they always say "BIGFOOT!" This tall, hairy, furry, large, fast, hairy man is well known as the most sought-after American of all time. There are scores of people who spend their whole lives looking for only him, never to catch more than a passing glance, like ships in the night. A well-read EXTRATERRESTRIAL Expert can see the signs a mile away of a being from beyond our star. Such a gentle, remarkable creature is clearly intelligent enough for communication, meaning that the only obstacle in the way in a lack of common language. With HUMAN TELEPATHY, would we be able to communicate with this kind, gentle, hairy beast???? Evidence points to YES!!!!

            <h4>MOTHMAN OR MOTHALIEN???</h4>
            Countless pieces of evidence show that Earth is not the only planet to support life. The type of life made on this planet is not neccessarily unique to here. There is proof that some plants, animals, and even mammals exist elsewhere in the INFINITE REACHES OF SPACE!!!! Some would say that common Earth creatures may even originate from outside our planet's orbit or even our solar system, arriving by meteor or asteroid (such as giraffes). The confusiuon about the Mothman, whether it is a moth or a man, clearly comes from a limited understanding of how living things born off-planet may differ in size, shape, color, or even features. Large red eyes and bipedal stature are dead givingaways: this is an alien people. The missing persons are just another case of MISCOMMUNICATION! Just think of the possible lives saved by using human telepathy to talk to these alien beasts.

            <h4>SLENDER MAN OR SLENDER *ALIEN*????</h4>
            We have known for years, even centuries now, that many aliens are humanoid in nature and form. Think of the common grey- lumpy and large face that may be missing human features, tall stature with gangly limbs, strange task in clothing likely influenced by their contacts with the "Men in Black"- these are perfect matches for the cryptid known as "Slenderman." Honestly, I think it's insane I'm the first to suggest this... it seems so obvious that shouldn't everyone already understand that Slenderman is an alien? While considered violent, I think one look at Slenderman will clarify the issue- no mouth, no way to speak. Perhaps with the help of a telepath, we could better understand Slenderman's needs and wants and just say to leave people filming alone.

            <h4>ROSWELL: A SHAMEFUL DISASTER</h4>
            Again in the United States of America, one of the most famous instances of alien attempted contact ended in tragedy. During the Roswell insident, a group of well-meaning aliens suffered an accident upon landing. Humans heartlessly obtained the aliens and rather than help and heal them, took them into labs for experimentation and study, including vivisection. SIMPLY MONSTEROUS. Such beautiful creatures must be protected, especially since the only reason they needed to visit us personally is likely due to our own weak telepathy.

            <h4>HUMAN TO ALIEN COMMUNICATION: IS THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE THROUGH TELEPATHY????</h4>
            Readers who are paying attention will notice I have mentioned human telepathy several times now in relation to the search for aliens. I believe science has been unsuccessful in its search due to overlooking this possible solution. While we have not yet found a human capable of telepathy, we can theorize what this skills could be used for:

            Human thinks about what they want to communicate
            Human words get turned into abstract concepts and feelings by their brain
            Rays of abstract information are sent to the aliens
            Alien brains receive the rays as abstract concepts and emotions
            Alien brains turn these into their own alien words as they understand what the human was trying to convey

            With enough time eand effort, a human telepath could perfect a method to send their thoughts out into space for any kind alien to receive. Considering humans are still so primitive, the chances we can communicate verbally or otherwise to aliens in slim and this is likely our only chance to be understood by aliens. Should scientists finally put the proper resources to investigating these theories, we may find that the power we needed was inside us the entire time. (If you are a telepath.)
